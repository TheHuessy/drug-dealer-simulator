What will this look like?

Gameplay:
    Player starts with X money and/or debt
    Turn based
    each turn:
        show available drugs and prices
        make purchases/sales
            prices don't change until you leave (turn over)
        New wares each jump
            Types change as well as prices
                Different areas offer/don't offer certain goods based on reputation
                    Should reputation bean actual value?
        turn ends when you move to another area


Later on:
    Random 'events' as you move from place to place
        cops
        find money
        dramatic price shifts
