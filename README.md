## A Drug Dealer Simulator

Working with OOP by writing a well known, illicit economic simulator.

### Why?

Never hurts to practice more abstraction and OOP. Used to play flash versions of this game and will now make a CLI version. The ultimate goal would be to create a UI with pyQT to practice creation UIs.

### TODO:

 * Finish up first run on element classes

 * Add Gameplay class(es)
